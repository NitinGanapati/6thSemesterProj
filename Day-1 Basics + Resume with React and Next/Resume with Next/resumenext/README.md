This is a personal resume website built using Next.js. It’s simple, fast, and easy to update. You can showcase your skills, projects, and experience in a clean and professional way.

On Day 1, we built the resume using React, focusing on a clean layout and simple structure. The goal was to get the basic sections—About, Experience, Projects, and Contact—up and running. It was all about getting a solid foundation ready for customization and styling later on.
