On Day 3, we were introduced to the power of routing in Next.js, including dynamic routes and nested pages. We also worked with useContext to manage global state across our application, which helped in passing data efficiently without prop drilling. The focus was on learning how to structure a multi-page application with Next.js's file-based routing system and understanding how to render pages conditionally based on user interaction or data. We also explored how to handle server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for improved performance and SEO.
